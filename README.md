#  O2C Insights Dashboard – Excel & Power BI

This project showcases an **end-to-end Order-to-Cash (O2C) Insights Dashboard** built using **Excel for data cleaning** and **Power BI for analytics and visualization**.  
It highlights my ability to work on **real-world data pipelines, transformations, KPIs, and interactive reporting** that can drive actionable business decisions.

##  KPIs & Metrics Built
Here are the key KPIs and visualizations implemented in the dashboard:

| **KPI / Visualization** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|-----------------|

##  Process Workflow
### **Phase 1: Data Cleaning**
- Cleaned raw order, invoice, and payment data in **Excel**  
- Removed duplicate records and invalid rows (e.g., `amount = 0`)  
- Formatted `order_date` and `payment_date` columns into proper datetime fields  
- Automated part of the cleaning via a **Python script** for efficiency

### **Phase 2: Data Loading & Modeling**
- Imported cleaned data into Power BI  
- Built relationships between `Orders`, `Invoices`, and `Payments` tables  
- Created calculated fields and measures for key KPIs  

### **Phase 3: Dashboard & KPIs**
- Designed interactive visualizations and KPIs in Power BI  
- Added slicers for year/month filtering  
- Formatted visuals for professional presentation
